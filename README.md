# Car_recommendation_model

The analysis is carried out to study the acceptability of a car based on various parameters such as price, maintenance, doors, seats, safety and storage. The study was carried out on 1728 total observations to best classify the acceptability of a car to customers based on the following classes by creating models using Decision Tree and Random Forest classification algorithms:
• acc
• good
• unacc
• vgood
Based on the developed models, the Random Forest algorithm with 10-fold cross validation results in the best accuracy. The study and models are explained in detail in the report.
